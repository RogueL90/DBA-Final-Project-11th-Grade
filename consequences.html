        <h3>Welcome to the Consequences page of OceanAwareness.org!</h3>
        <p>Here, we delve deeper into the specific damages caused by pollution in our oceans, focusing on the heartbreaking impact on iconic marine species like sea turtles and fish. Through vivid visual representations and powerful narratives, we highlight the direct consequences of human waste on these creatures and their habitats.

        <p>Here in these images you can see marine life in the wake of pollution. See images of sea turtles and other ocean life entangled in discarded plastic bags, struggling to break free as their delicate bodies are ensnared by human debris. 
            There are devastating effects of ingesting plastic on marine animals, from seabirds with stomachs filled with bottle caps to whales stranded on beaches with bellies full of plastic bags. Witness the toll of pollution on coral reefs, as vibrant ecosystems suffocate under blankets of plastic and other debris.

            <h3>The Human Connection:</h3>
            <p>These images serve as a stark reminder that our actions have real, tangible consequences for the creatures that inhabit our oceans. Every piece of plastic we discard, every pollutant we release into the sea, has the potential to harm marine life and disrupt fragile ecosystems.
                But amidst the devastation, there is hope. By raising awareness and taking action to reduce our plastic footprint, we can mitigate the damage and protect the ocean habitats that are vital to the survival of countless species.

            <h3>What you can do:</h3>
            <p>As you scroll through this page, we urge you to channel your emotions into action. Support initiatives that promote plastic-free oceans, participate in beach clean-ups, and advocate for policies that reduce pollution and protect marine habitats.
                Together, we can turn the tide on ocean pollution and create a future where sea turtles, fish, and all marine life can thrive in clean and healthy seas. Let's stand together as stewards of the ocean, ensuring a sustainable legacy for generations to come.
