        <h3>Welcome to the Impact page of OceanAwareness.org!</h3>
        <p>Here, we confront the harsh reality of how humanity's actions are wreaking havoc on the very sea life that sustains us. Through compelling visuals and eye-opening videos, we shed light on the devastating consequences of pollution, overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change on marine ecosystems.

        <p>Watch as we take you beneath the surface of our oceans, where the truth about human impact unfolds. Witness firsthand the staggering amount of trash dumped into our seas, from plastic debris clogging coastlines to discarded fishing gear ensnaring marine animals. See how these pollutants entangle, suffocate, and starve sea creatures, causing unimaginable suffering and death.
            But the destruction doesn't end there. Overfishing depletes fish stocks, disrupting entire food chains and pushing species towards extinction. Dive into coral reefs bleached by rising temperatures and acidic waters, leaving vibrant ecosystems barren and lifeless.

        <h3>Humanity's Footprint:</h3>
        <p>Every piece of trash, every net cast, every degree of temperature rise leaves a mark on our oceans. The consequences ripple outward, affecting not only marine life but also the millions of people who depend on the sea for food and livelihoods.
